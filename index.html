            This system sounds like a URL shortener and QR code generator. A URL shortener is a tool that takes a long
            URL and shortens it into a shorter, more manageable URL that redirects to the original link. QR codes are
            two-dimensional barcodes that can store a variety of information, such as a URL. When scanned by a
            smartphone or other device with a QR code reader, the device will automatically open the URL stored in the
            QR code. To implement this system, you could use an existing URL shortening service, such as Bitly or cutty,
            to generate the shortened URL. You could then use a QR code generation library or service to create a QR
            code that contains the shortened URL. When scanned, the QR code would take the user to the shortened URL,
            which would then redirect them to the original URL.It makes the Work smooth and easily.
